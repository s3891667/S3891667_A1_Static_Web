            <p>I'm a 20 years old coder currently studying at <strong>RMIT University</strong> and this is my second year. </p>
            <p>Experiences: I am able to code in some languages such as, Python, Java, C/C++, HTML, CSS and a little MySQL. Furthermore,
            I have the ability to work in a team as well as knowledges in problem solving in tech-industry. Yet, I haven't got any 
            reality experiences neither projects.<br>Therefore, my decision is to have internship after this semester.</p>

                <h2>My thoughts about the industry</h2>
                <p>From my perspective, I see that information technology is interesting to study as well as work as a developer. Specifically,
                    different from other careers every day IT comes up with many new things that created, researched by coders around the world; Therefore,
                    to keep yourself involve in IT you have to update knowledges rapidly, consecutive. And I am looking forward to becoming a Data Analytic 
                    in the future.
